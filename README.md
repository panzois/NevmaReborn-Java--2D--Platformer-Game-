# Nevma Reborn – Java 2D Platformer (WIP Prototype)

🚧 Work in Progress – Early Development Stage  

This repository currently contains core Java classes of a 2D platformer game built with LibGDX.  
It represents an in-progress prototype focused on gameplay logic and architecture.

⚠️ This is NOT a runnable build.  
The project does not yet include the full LibGDX Gradle setup or game assets.
